            <p><img src="assets/images/erik.jpg" alt="My picture">Hello! I'm Erik. You probably know me as the guy who
                sits in the middle row at
                class who is always wearing a hat. What you may not know is that I am married
                (15 years), have 1 son, 2 dogs (Stewie and Bowser) and 1
                stupid cat (Kitty). I'm born and raised in WA and have a great family who all live pretty close which is
                nice. My favorite holiday is Christmas and my least favorite (major) holiday is Thanksgiving.</p>

            <p>During my free time (when not in this bootcamp), I enjoy playing video games
                (Playstation 4, Xbox One, & Nintendo Switch), watching football (Go Cougs/Go Hawks), reading, going to
                movies, riding mtn bike/motorcycle, and spending time with my wife, son and dogs. I also really enjoy
                listening to music. Some of my favorite artists are Billy Joel, Chvrches, New Found Glory, Taylor Swift
                (all her albums except her most recent album, that one was trash), Styx, Paramore and Panic! At The
                Disco. I also really love Legos! I have a large collection made up mostly of the larger sets that I have
                accumulated over the last
                15 years or so. I had a lot of Legos when I was a kid and I was stupid and sold most of them at a garage
                sale many years ago. That was one of the worst decisions that I've ever made. </p>

            <p>Oh, and I work full time. I don't enjoy it. Not much else to say about that.</p>
